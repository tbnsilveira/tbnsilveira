# hello-world
This repository was created in 2017 to get acquainted with the GitHub structure and its functional commands. Nowadays, **git** is a fundamental tool I use daily as a data scientist, researcher, and professor. That said, it's time to update this list...

## My current research projects:
- Semantic attribution computability
- Classification of semantic content

## Some more words on my themes of interest:
### Intelligent Systems:
This is the theme of my undergoing doctorate research in computational intelligence. In this context, natural language appears as the utmost human characteristic, and its processing is still an open problem in computing. My research focuses on semantic attribution and applies to psychometry, NLP, and CV.

### Network Intelligence and Telecommunications:
I have a particular interest in **5G** (5th-Generation Wireless System), **Software-Defined Networks (SDN)** and **Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)**. These three technologies are responsible for a paradigm shift from traditional network topologies to software-defined ones, mainly based on *resources available and services demanded*. I'm also interested in **Internet of Things (IoT)** architectures and applications.

### Data Science and Signal Processing:  
As a data scientist, I'm interested in analytical tools based on **wavelets**, Fourier transform, time series, and Bayesian models. I'm also levering on **MLOps** techniques for big data.
