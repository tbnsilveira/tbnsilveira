# hello-world
First **N**-impressions and information...  

This project was created five years ago to get acquainted with the GitHub structure and its functional commands. Besides, the purpose of this project was to register the themes I was working on, therefore bringing a short description of my primary research and professional projects. Nowadays, **git** is a fundamental tool I use daily as a data scientist, researcher, and professor. That said, it's time to update this list...

## Themes of interest:
### Intelligent Systems:
This is the theme of my undergoing doctorate research in computational intelligence, in which I look for modeling intelligent agents based on their perception and decision-making tasks. In this context, natural language appears as the utmost human characteristic, and its processing is still an open problem in computing. My approach is to understand language through a neuropsychoanalytic approach to develop algorithms capable of dealing with syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. 

### Network Intelligence:
I have a particular interest in **5G** (5th-Generation Wireless System), **Software-Defined Networks (SDN)** and **Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)**. These three technologies are responsible for a paradigm shift from traditional network topologies to software-defined ones, mainly based on *resources available and services demanded*. I'm also interested in **Internet of Things (IoT)** architectures and applications.

### Data Science and Signal Processing:  
I am particularly interested in working with *digital signal processing*, mainly through the use of **discrete wavelet transform (DWT)** applied to one-dimensional signals. I am also interested in *digital image processing* focusing on object segmentation. As a data scientist, I'm interested in analytical tools based on wavelets, Fourier transform, time series, and Bayesian models. I'm also working on **MLOps** techniques for big data.

## Research, Development, and Innovation:
RD&I are inserted on any of the above subjects. Here it represents my interest in the methodologies and best practices to develop research in any of the mentioned areas, as well as risk evaluation, research management, and roadmapping techniques. 

> Current research projects:
> - Semantic attribution computability;
> - Classification of semantic content;
> - MLOps for hybrid (on-premises | cloud) environment.
